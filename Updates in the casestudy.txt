	-> user account approval and closure
	-> bank account and loan - approval and closure

	Only for the closure the user have to apply, for approval while creating 
	the user or bank account, it will automatically inserted to approval_request.

The loan part is implemented as we discussed,
__________________________________________________
	->First the loan list will be shown to the customer,
	->Then for applying the customer will enter his/her accountnumber, loanname, loanamount and income(will be added to the users table).

	-> Loan approval request will be added in the ApprovalRequest table.

		Loan approval is based on two things, 
			->income and 
			->totaldeposit should be greater than totalwithdraw  
			For that a new method is added,
				->ShowEligibility - to show the conditions as a result, created a POJO class EligibilityResponse.

	-> After the approval, the first installment will be created.
	-> The customer will be notified one day before the installment due date via mail.
		For this a new class Email service and service class is created.

	-> Then for paying the installments the customer will enter loanid, paymentdate, paymentType, paymentAmount and remarks.
	-> After the payment is done, the next installment for this loan will be added in the installments table.
	-> The total balance in loan table will be reduced by the installments amount.

	-> If the loan tenure is in the last month then the customer has to request for the BankManager to loan close.
	-> The loan will get closed only when total balance is 0 and status of the loan is "CanClose" which will be set the BankManager if approves the loan closure.
	-> The same way a customer can apply for Early closing of loan 

		But it is based on two things, 
			->mininumtenure of that particular loan(a column added in loan list) , 
			->repayment points
		To show these conditions and verdict to the BankManager, created a POJO class LoanDetailsResponse

	->Based on that LoanDetailsResponse, the BankManager will approve or reject the loan closure.
